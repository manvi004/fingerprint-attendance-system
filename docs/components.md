# Hardware Components

The system is built using the following components:

1. ESP32 microcontroller for control, Wi-Fi connectivity, and logic
2. Fingerprint sensor with internal storage for up to 128 templates
3. I2C LCD module for user feedback
4. Wi-Fi connection for IoT data transmission

The fingerprint sensor performs enrollment and matching internally,
while the ESP32 manages user interaction and data communication.
